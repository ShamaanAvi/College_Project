"Developed as the culmination of my Diploma in IT Programming, this library management system is a robust Windows Forms Application built using .NET C# and integrated with MS SQL Server for database management. The system offers comprehensive functionalities tailored for efficient library operations. Users can easily catalog books, manage member information, track borrowing and returns. This project not only showcases my proficiency in software development but also highlights my expertise in designing intuitive user interfaces and implementing database-driven applications."
